## Linear Regression for Predict MPG

#### Statistics :

  * R-squared value = .715
  * p-value is 5.32e-11
  * Slope is not equal to zero 
  
#### Statistics Explained

 * The R-squared value is .715 which means that roughly 71% of the predictions made by this Linear Regression model will be correct therefor it does a very decent   job at preidcting outcomes but it is not the best it could be.
 * Since the p value is lower than significance level of .05, we must reject the null hypothesis which means slope is not equal to zero implying that as the y value does not stay constant as x increases. In other words that there is a significant relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

* Based on the Total Summary the variance is 62.3 so it is within range but taking a look at each lot individually we can see that Lot 1 and 2 meet the design specifications with variances of .9 and 7.4 while Lot 3 far exceeds specifications.
